One sunny morning, Dora and Boots were playing near the river when they found a bottle with a message inside. Dora opened it and read aloud, “Help! I lost my treasure near Crocodile Lake!” Excited for a new adventure, Dora grabbed her backpack, and Map jumped out to help. Map said, “First, go through the Tall Grass, then past the Spooky Cave, and finally to Crocodile Lake!”

As they walked through the Tall Grass, they heard rustling sounds—whoosh, whoosh! It was Benny the Bull, stuck in a bush! Dora and Boots helped him out, and he gave them a shiny key. “You might need this later,” said Benny. They continued on to the Spooky Cave, where they needed the flashlight from Backpack to see. Inside, they met a sleeping bat and tiptoed quietly so they wouldn’t wake it. After carefully exiting the cave, they finally reached Crocodile Lake, where they saw the treasure on a small island.

To reach the treasure, they needed to cross the lake—but the bridge was missing! That’s when Dora remembered Benny’s key. She spotted a hidden lever by the shore and used the key to activate it. A bridge unfolded, and Dora and Boots crossed safely to the island. Inside the treasure chest was a note: “Thank you for being brave!” Dora and Boots cheered, “We did it!” and danced all the way home.
